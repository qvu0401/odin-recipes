    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A fried egg is a quick and easy breakfast classic that takes just a few minutes to make. It’s prepared by cooking a cracked egg in a lightly oiled or buttered pan until the whites are set and the yolk reaches your preferred doneness. This simple dish can stand alone or be served on toast, rice, or alongside bacon and veggies for a complete meal.</p>
    <p>With minimal ingredients and little effort, fried eggs are a perfect choice for busy mornings. You can keep the yolk soft and gooey or flip it for a firmer texture—either way, it’s a nutritious and versatile option.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is melted and hot, crack the egg into the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 2-3 minutes until the whites are set but the yolk is still runny. For over-easy, carefully flip the egg and cook for an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately on its own or with your favorite sides.</li>
    </ol>
